## USE SAKILA;

Changes the active database to SAKILA. All subsequent operations will be performed on this database.

## CREATE TABLE KOI ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL );

Creates a new table named KOI with two columns:

id: of type INT, set to auto-increment, and is the primary key.
name: of type VARCHAR with a maximum length of 100 characters and cannot be null.
-- Query data from the ADDRESS table
Comment indicating that the next query is to retrieve data from the ADDRESS table.

## SELECT CITY_ID, PHONE, DISTRICT, LOCATION FROM ADDRESS;

Query that selects and displays the columns CITY_ID, PHONE, DISTRICT, and LOCATION from the ADDRESS table.

## SELECT \* FROM KOI;

Query that selects and displays all data from the KOI table. At this point, the table is empty because it was just created.

## TRUNCATE TABLE KOI;

The TRUNCATE TABLE command removes all records from the KOI table quickly and efficiently but retains the table structure. Itâ€™s like clearing all the contents of the table without deleting it. TRUNCATE TABLE cannot be used if there are foreign key constraints referring to the table.

## SELECT \* FROM KOI;

Query that selects and displays all data from the KOI table. After using TRUNCATE TABLE, the KOI table should be empty, so the result will be an empty table.
