# Introduction to SQL

SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases. SQL operates through simple, declarative statements. This keeps data accurate and secure, and helps maintain the integrity of databases, regardless of size.

The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications. Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.

The statements covered in this course use SQLite Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). You can also access a glossary of all the SQL commands taught in this course.

```sql
 SELECT * FROM celebs
```

The line of code you provided is written in SQL, which is a programming language designed for managing relational databases. Let's break down the syntax and explain its functionality:

**SELECT:** This keyword is used to retrieve data from a database. It specifies that you want to retrieve specific columns or all columns from a table.

**(asterisk):** In SQL, the asterisk (\*) is a wildcard character that represents all columns. When used after the SELECT keyword, it indicates that you want to retrieve all columns from the table.
FROM: This keyword is used to specify the table from which you want to retrieve the data. In this case, the table name is "celebs."

In summary, the line of code **SELECT** FROM celebs" is a SQL query that retrieves all columns from the "celebs" table. It is requesting to retrieve all the data from every column available in the "celebs" table.
